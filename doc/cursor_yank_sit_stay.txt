*cursor_yank_sit_stay.txt* For Neovim version 0.5 Last change: 2023 Jul 24

CursorYankSitStay is a Neovim plugin that helps to maintain the cursor position
after yanking text. It also provides a visual highlight of the yanked area.

By default, after a yank operation in Neovim, the cursor moves to the beginning
of the yanked area. This can be disorienting if you're in the middle of editing
text. CursorYankSitStay solves this problem by returning the cursor to its 
original position after a yank operation.

The name of the plugin is a playful reference to the behavior of a well-behaved
dog. Like a good dog, the cursor "sits and stays" where you tell it to, even
after an active "fetch" (yank) command.

==============================================================================
Commands~

:CursorYankSitStayEnable
    Enable the CursorYankSitStay plugin.

:CursorYankSitStayDisable
    Disable the CursorYankSitStay plugin. Note that this only disables the cursor
    position maintaining feature, the yank highlighting will still work as it is
    a standard part of Neovim.

:CursorYankSitStayToggle
    Toggle the CursorYankSitStay plugin on and off.

This plugin does not provide any default keymaps. You have to define your own
keymaps to use the above commands. Here are some examples:

    nnoremap <leader>cyse :CursorYankSitStayEnable<CR>
    nnoremap <leader>cysd :CursorYankSitStayDisable<CR>
    nnoremap <leader>cyst :CursorYankSitStayToggle<CR>

==============================================================================
Configuration~

The following options can be set in your Neovim configuration file to control
the behavior of CursorYankSitStay:

- `highlight_group` (default: 'IncSearch')
    This option controls the highlight group used for the yank highlight. You
    can set it to any valid highlight group. Other possibly good options include
    'Underlined'.

- `highlight_durations` (default: { char = 1000, line = 500 })
    This option controls the duration of the yank highlight for different types
    of yanks (character-wise, line-wise). The duration is in milliseconds.

- `enabled` (default: true)
    This option controls whether the plugin is enabled or not.

==============================================================================
Installation~

1. Use a plugin manager such as Packer:
    ```
    use {
      'YourGithubUsername/cursor_yank_sit_stay',
      config = function()
        require('cursor_yank_sit_stay').setup({
          highlight_group = 'IncSearch',
          highlight_durations = {
            char = 1000,
            line = 500,
          },
          enabled = true,
        })
      end,
    }
    ```
    Replace 'YourGithubUsername/cursor_yank_sit_stay' with your actual Github
    username and repository name. Replace the configuration options with your
    desired settings.

2. After installing the plugin with your plugin manager, restart Neovim.
